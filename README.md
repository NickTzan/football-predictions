# Predicinting the Outcomes of Football Matches with Data from FBref.com

The goal of this repo is to create a model that can predict the results of football fames based on different features like the home/away advantage, the recent history of the team, the day and the time of the match (maybe playing on a Monday is worse for the team?).
Other features as well as different models will be examined. 
Initially the models will be optimized with data from the Spanish La Liga, though in the future a pipeline will be create that will allow training and testing in other leagues too (any league actually).
Finally, a UI will be created where the user will be able to query results for desired teams.
